based on Wikipedia:
  Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram. 
  This technique typically enhances the overall contrast of images,
   particularly when the image has a limited range of intensity values. 
   By redistributing the intensity levels more evenly across the entire histogram, it makes better use of the available dynamic range. 
   As a result, areas with low local contrast become more visually distinct.   Histogram equalization achieves this by redistributing 
   frequently occurring intensity values, which are often responsible for reduced image contrast.

This method is particularly usefull with images that both background and foreground are in similar tone, such like xray of bone. 
Histogram equalization often produce non natural effects on image, but it is good for scientific data collection. 
To our advantage OpenCV has already implemented method for this algorithm.

Despite histogram equalization key advantages we will not use it in our project. 
The main disadvantage is loss of details in in areas that are too bright or too dark and possibility of data loss in great contrasted areas. 
This algorithm can also make small artifacts more visible.

Histogram equalization may be used only in specific conditions which doesn`t much wanted flexibility of our model.
